Contributing
============

There will be a development branch for each version of this package i.e. v1-development, please
make your pull requests against those branches.

If changes are breaking please create an issue, for discussion and create a pull request against
the highest development branch for example this package has a v1 and v1-development branch
however, there will also be a v2-development brach even though v2 doesn't exist yet.

I strongly encourage everyone whom creates a custom validation function to contribute them and
help make this package even better.
